#Introduction 

The proportional multi-state multiple-cohort life table model (PMSLT) is a population level model (macro) approach to simulate health (and economic) implications of changes in exposure to health risk factors (e.g. physical inactivity, air pollution and diet). The PMSLT has been widely used to simulate outcomes for population level interventions for the reduction of chronic diseases. 

The model was developed by Jan Barendregt and colleagues (REF ACE prevention and core papers) and has been widely used in Australia and New Zealand (Ref ACE-report and BODE website of key publications). 

The basic infrastructure of the model consist of three components: (1) Effect size for the intervention of interest (e.g. intervention to urban design that modifies population levels of physical activity); (2) Calculation of the potential impact fraction (PIF) to derive the change in occurence of disease (indidence rate/mortality rate) attributable to a change in the distrubution of the risk factor (e.g. physical activity); and (3) Use of the PMSLT to simulate health (and economic) outcomes attributable to a change in the distribution of health risk factor/s in the population of interest. Figure 1 summarises the basic infrastructure of the model.

Examples of outputs
## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
